# Why BioMAJ ?

Biological knowledge in a genomic or post-genomic context is mainly based on transitive bioinformatics analysis consisting in an iterative and periodic comparison of data newly produced against corpus of known information.

In large scale projects, this approach needs accurate bioinformatics software, pipelines, interfaces and numerous heterogeneous biological banks, which are distributed around the world. An integration process that consists in mirroring and indexing this data is obviously an essential preliminary step but represents a major challenge and a bottleneck in most bioinformatics projects; BioMAJ addresses this problem by proposing a flexible and robust automated environment.
